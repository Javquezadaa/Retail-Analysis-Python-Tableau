Retail Customer Segmentation and Sales Analysis

This project analyzes a large-scale retail dataset to understand customer behavior, identify top-performing brands and countries, perform customer segmentation, and develop actionable business recommendations through data visualization and predictive modeling.

⸻

Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
	•	Understand customer purchasing behavior across segments and regions
	•	Identify key product brands driving purchases and revenue
	•	Build customer clusters to guide segmentation strategies
	•	Uncover time-based revenue trends and seasonality
	•	Evaluate predictive models to support marketing and forecasting decisions

⸻

Key Business Questions

Customer Behavior Patterns
	•	Which customer segments contribute the most revenue?
	•	How do customer ratings vary by segment and spending?
	•	Which regions and countries generate the highest revenue?
	•	What behaviors and patterns emerge across clusters?

Product and Brand Insights
	•	Which brands dominate in terms of purchase frequency and revenue?
	•	How do product categories perform across clusters?

Time Series and Forecasting
	•	What is the monthly revenue trend over time?
	•	Are there repeating seasonal patterns?
	•	What do autocorrelation plots and model residuals suggest about forecasting complexity?

Segmentation and Modeling
	•	What customer profiles emerge from clustering?
	•	How accurately can we predict total spending from the number of purchases?

	•	Ratings: Most customers gave positive feedback (Good or Excellent)
	•	Clusters:
	•	Cluster 3: High spenders
	•	Cluster 1: Active and regular
	•	Cluster 0: Moderate buyers
	•	Cluster 2: Low spenders – re-engagement opportunity
	•	Revenue Trend: Downward trend with clear 6-month seasonal pattern
	•	Regression: Total purchases predict spending moderately well, with room for model improvement

⸻

Future Use Cases
	•	Personalized marketing based on clusters
	•	Product recommendations driven by segment behavior
	•	Campaign strategies for loyalty, upsell, and reactivation
	•	Forecasting with external and seasonal variables
